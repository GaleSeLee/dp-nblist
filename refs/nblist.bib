	abstract = {We present an algorithm based on linear bounding volume hierarchies ({LBVHs}) for computing neighbor (Verlet) lists using graphics processing units ({GPUs}) for colloidal systems characterized by large size disparities. We compare this to a {GPU} implementation of the current state-of-the-art {CPU} algorithm based on stenciled cell lists. We report benchmarks for both neighbor list algorithms in a Lennard-Jones binary mixture with synthetic interaction range disparity and a realistic colloid solution. {LBVHs} outperformed the stenciled cell lists for systems with moderate or large size disparity and dilute or semidilute fractions of large particles, conditions typical of colloidal systems.},

We have incorporated it into {OpenMM}, a library for performing molecular simulations on high performance computer architectures. We benchmark it on a variety of systems including boxes of water molecules, proteins in explicit solvent, a lipid bilayer, and proteins with implicit solvent. The results demonstrate that its performance scales linearly with the number of atoms over a wide range of system sizes, while being significantly faster than other published algorithms.},

	abstract = {The introduction of accelerator devices such as graphics processing units ({GPUs}) has had profound impact on molecular dynamics simulations and has enabled order-of-magnitude performance advances using commodity hardware. To fully reap these benefits, it has been necessary to reformulate some of the most fundamental algorithms, including the Verlet list, pair searching, and cutoffs. Here, we present the heterogeneous parallelization and acceleration design of molecular dynamics implemented in the {GROMACS} codebase over the last decade. The setup involves a general cluster-based approach to pair lists and non-bonded pair interactions that utilizes both {GPU} and central processing unit ({CPU}) single instruction, multiple data acceleration efficiently, including the ability to load-balance tasks between {CPUs} and {GPUs}. The algorithm work efficiency is tuned for each type of hardware, and to use accelerators more efficiently, we introduce dual pair lists with rolling pruning updates. Combined with new direct {GPU}-{GPU} communication and {GPU} integration, this enables excellent performance from single {GPU} simulations through strong scaling across multiple {GPUs} and efficient multi-node parallelization.},
